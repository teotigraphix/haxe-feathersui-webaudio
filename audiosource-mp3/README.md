## Run locally

This project includes an project.xml file that configures all options for OpenFL. This file makes it easy to build from the command line, and many IDEs can parse this file to configure a Haxe project to use OpenFL.

## Prerequisites

- [Install Haxe 4.0.0 or newer](https://haxe.org/download/).
- [Install Feathers UI from Haxelib](https://feathersui.com/learn/haxe-openfl/installation/)

### Command Line

Run the [**openfl**](https://www.openfl.org/learn/haxelib/docs/tools/) tool in your terminal:

```sh
haxelib run openfl test html5
```

WebAudio means `html5` target only.
